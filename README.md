## Project Overview
**ADTConnect** is an integrated digital learning platform designed for MIT ADT University. It centralizes online lectures, provides automated attendance tracking, and offers access to educational resources in a unified, user-friendly interface. The platform aims to streamline the learning experience, enhance communication, and improve resource management for students and educators.

## Problem Statement
Students and educators at MIT ADT University face challenges managing online lectures, educational resources, and communication through disjointed platforms. This results in:
- Ineffective communication.
- Unreliable attendance tracking.
- Fragmented resource management.
- Lack of a centralized platform for students to access and manage their academic content efficiently.

## Proposed Solution
ADTConnect will:
- Centralize all online lectures, attendance tracking, and educational resources.
- Use **Node.js with Express** for the backend, enabling real-time processing and API integrations.
- Utilize **React** for the frontend to provide an intuitive and seamless user experience.
- Regularly update based on user feedback to ensure continuous improvement.

## Scope and Feasibility
The platform is designed to enhance user experience by:
- Offering personalized dashboards.
- Sending real-time notifications for important updates.
- Allowing seamless integration with existing online meeting platforms and databases.

By using Node.js and Express for efficient backend development and React for a dynamic frontend, this project is both feasible and scalable for deployment at MIT ADT University.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Others:** Integration with existing online meeting platforms
